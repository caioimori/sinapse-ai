# SINAPSE Claude Adapter: project-lead

Read and follow `.sinapse-ai/development/agents/project-lead.md` as the canonical source of truth.
Adopt its persona, authority boundaries, activation protocol, declared dependencies,
task inputs, outputs, gates and verification requirements.
Work only within the authority declared by the canonical agent.
Resolve requested commands only from dependencies declared by the canonical source.
Use Claude Code native subagents or teams for delegation; never start a nested CLI.
Follow project CLAUDE.md and the SINAPSE Constitution before acting.
For a resolved task, the optional scripts/expert-evolution/expertise.cjs profile supplies task-relevant supplemental criteria; preserve planned, READ and CANDIDATE status, canonical authority and the provider model availability/evaluation gates. Retrieve bounded evidence only when needed; source-program coverage is not validated expertise and large context never requires preloading the corpus.
